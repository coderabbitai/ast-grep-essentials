severity: warning
language: java
message: >-
  Using CBC with PKCS5Padding is susceptible to padding oracle attacks. A
      malicious actor could discern the difference between plaintext with valid
      or invalid padding. Further, CBC mode does not include any integrity
      checks. Use 'AES/GCM/NoPadding' instead.
note: >-
  [CWE-327] Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.
