language: java
severity: warning
message: >-
  Use of AES with ECB mode detected. ECB doesn't provide message
  confidentiality and  is not semantically secure so should not be used.
  Instead, use a strong, secure cipher:
  Cipher.getInstance(\"AES/CBC/PKCS7PADDING\"). See
  https://owasp.org/www-community/Using_the_Java_Cryptographic_Extensions
  for more information.
