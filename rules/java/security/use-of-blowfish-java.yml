severity: info
message: >-
  Use of Blowfish was detected. Blowfish uses a 64-bit block size
      that  makes it vulnerable to birthday attacks, and is therefore considered
      non-compliant.  Instead, use a strong, secure cipher:
      Cipher.getInstance("AES/CBC/PKCS7PADDING"). See
      https://owasp.org/www-community/Using_the_Java_Cryptographic_Extensions
      for more information.
