message: >-
  Detected SHA1 hash algorithm which is considered insecure. SHA1 is not
  collision resistant and is therefore not suitable as a cryptographic
  signature. Instead, use PBKDF2 for password hashing or SHA256 or SHA512
  for other hash function applications.
note: >-
  [CWE-328] Use of Weak Hash.
