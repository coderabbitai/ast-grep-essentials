language: java
severity: warning
message: >-
  DOCTYPE declarations are enabled for $DBFACTORY. Without prohibiting
    external entity declarations, this is vulnerable to XML external entity
    attacks. Disable this by setting the feature
    "http://apache.org/xml/features/disallow-doctype-decl" to true.
    Alternatively, allow DOCTYPE declarations and only prohibit external
    entities declarations. This can be done by setting the features
    "http://xml.org/sax/features/external-general-entities" and
    "http://xml.org/sax/features/external-parameter-entities" to false.
