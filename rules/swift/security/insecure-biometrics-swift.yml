message: >-
  The application was observed to leverage biometrics via Local
      Authentication, which returns a simple boolean result for authentication.
      This design is subject to bypass with runtime tampering tools such as
      Frida, Substrate, and others. Although this is limited to rooted
      (jailbroken) devices, consider implementing biometric authentication the
      reliable way - via Keychain Services.
