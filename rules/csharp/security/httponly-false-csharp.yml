  "Detected a cookie where the `HttpOnly` flag is either missing or
      disabled. The `HttpOnly` cookie flag instructs the browser to forbid
      client-side JavaScript to read the cookie. If JavaScript interaction is
      required, you can ignore this finding. However, set the `HttpOnly` flag to
      `true` in all other cases. If this wasn't intentional, it's recommended to
      set the HttpOnly flag to true so the cookie will not be accessible through
      client-side scripts or to use the Cookie Policy Middleware to globally set
      the HttpOnly flag. You can then use the CookieOptions class when
      instantiating the cookie, which inherits these settings and will require
      future developers to have to explicitly override them on a case-by-case
      basis if needed. This approach ensures cookies are secure by default."
