language: python
message: >-
  Detected ARC4 cipher algorithm which is considered insecure. This
  algorithm is not cryptographically secure and can be reversed easily. Use
  secure stream ciphers such as ChaCha20, XChaCha20 and Salsa20, or a block
  cipher such as AES with a block size of 128 bits. When using a block
  cipher, use a modern mode of operation that also provides authentication,
  such as GCM.
note: >-
  [CWE-327] Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.
