id: insecure-cipher-algorithm-rc4-python
severity: warning
language: python
message: >-
      Detected ARC4 cipher algorithm which is considered insecure. This
      algorithm is not cryptographically secure and can be reversed easily. Use
      secure stream ciphers such as ChaCha20, XChaCha20 and Salsa20, or a block
      cipher such as AES with a block size of 128 bits. When using a block
      cipher, use a modern mode of operation that also provides authentication,
      such as GCM.
note: >-
  [CWE-327] Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm.
