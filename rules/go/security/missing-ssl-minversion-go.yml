severity: warning
message: >-
      MinVersion` is missing from this TLS configuration.  By default, TLS
      1.2 is currently used as the minimum when acting as a client, and TLS 1.0
      when acting as a server. General purpose web applications should default
      to TLS 1.3 with all other protocols disabled.  Only where it is known that
      a web server must support legacy clients with unsupported an insecure
      browsers (such as Internet Explorer 10), it may be necessary to enable TLS
      1.0 to provide support. Add `MinVersion: tls.VersionTLS13' to the TLS
      configuration to bump the minimum version to TLS 1.3.
