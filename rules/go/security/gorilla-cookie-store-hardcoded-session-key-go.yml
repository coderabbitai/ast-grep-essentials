  A secret is hard-coded in the application. Secrets stored in source
  code, such as credentials, identifiers, and other types of sensitive data,
  can be leaked and used by internal or external malicious actors. It is
  recommended to rotate the secret and retrieve them from a secure secret
  vault or Hardware Security Module (HSM), alternatively environment
  variables can be used if allowed by your company policy.
