message: >-
  Found an insecure gRPC connection using 'grpc.WithInsecure()'. This
  creates a connection without encryption to a gRPC server. A malicious
  attacker could tamper with the gRPC message, which could compromise the
  machine. Instead, establish a secure connection with an SSL certificate
  using the 'grpc.WithTransportCredentials()' function. You can create a
  create credentials using a 'tls.Config{}' struct with
  'credentials.NewTLS()'. The final fix looks like this:
  'grpc.WithTransportCredentials(credentials.NewTLS(<config>))'.
